Summary: >
I am a curious person with an interest and entusiasm for technology and problem solving. I submitted my master degree summer 2017 in the field of Computational Science and Engineering at the University of Oslo / Simula. In my thesis I used advanced numerical methods for performing supercomputer simulations of micro-particles inhaled into the human respiratory system. My academic background involves a combination of mathematics and programming, in addition to physics and mechanics. By combining knowledge from different scientific fields, I am able to analyze advanced problems, and create and validate robust solutions to client problems.
