Summary: >
    I am a curious person with an interest and enthusiasm for technology and problem solving. I submitted my masterâ€™s thesis summer 2017 in the field of Computational Science and Engineering at the University of Oslo / Simula. In my work I performed numerical simulations of micro-particles inhaled into the human respiratory system. This involved writing Python scripts and working with open-source solutions and libraries, as well as data analysis and supercomputer simulations. My academic background involves a combination of mathematics and programming, together with insights in physics and fluid mechanics. During my studies I have developed my professional experience through part-time and holiday positions within teaching and customer service.
